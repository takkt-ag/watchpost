Execution environments and registry.

This module defines `Environment`, representing where a check runs or targets,
and `EnvironmentRegistry`, a simple container to manage named environments.

Notes:
    Environments can carry hostname configuration used during result output.

class Environment:
    """
    Represents a logical environment in which checks run.

    An environment typically maps to how or where checks are executed (for
    example: dev, stage, prod, monitoring). It can carry a hostname resolution
    strategy and arbitrary metadata that checks and data sources may use to
    alter behavior.

        Create a new environment definition.

        Parameters:
            name:

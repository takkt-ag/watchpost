"""
Datasource primitives and factory helpers.

This module defines the `Datasource` base class, the `DatasourceFactory`
protocol for constructing datasources, a `FromFactory` marker to declare
factory-created dependencies in check parameters, and a `DatasourceUnavailable`
exception to signal that a datasource is not available or otherwise unusable.

Notes:
    Datasources and factories can declare `scheduling_strategies` that Watchpost
    uses to decide where a check may run.
